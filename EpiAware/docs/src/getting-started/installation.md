# Installation

Eventually, `EpiAware` is likely to be added to the Julia registry. Until then, you can install it from the `/EpiAware` sub-directory of this repository by running the following command in the Julia REPL:

```julia
using Pkg; Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/CDCgov/Rt-without-renewal", subdir="EpiAware")
```
