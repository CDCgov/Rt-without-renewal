# [API reference](@id api-reference)

Welcome to the `EpiAware` API reference! This section is designed to help you understand the API of the package which is split into submodules.

The `EpiAware` package itself contains no functions or types. Instead, it re-exports the functions and types from its submodules. See the sidebar for the list of submodules.
